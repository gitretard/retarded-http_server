# DO NOT USE (if you are sane ofc)
You can change the root directory and if you allow directory listings or not BUT do not use this shit


Still not even good enough for my personal use imma fix it later

Issues;

1. Nil pointers (Happens sometimes and crashes teh entire server also idk hwo to fix it)

2. Some connection issues (mostly during form requests)

3. Goroutine leaks

4. Random errors idk how to fix it but it doesnt crash the entire program so who cares

5. Copypasting code

6. Random EOF error logs (Its fine)

unusable
